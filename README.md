# ADGSTUDIOS Markdown to HTML Converter - HTML to PDF Converter

I had problems using 8 converters to convert my markdown files to HTML and PDF. So I decided to make my own. This is a simple converter that converts markdown files to HTML and PDF. It is written in Python. Motivation for my implementation was the extension MarkdownToPDF for Visual Studio Code i researched everything about it and reversed engineered how they did it. Quite some cool stuff in there. I used the standard markdown library. To convert the markdown into html with some extensions.
